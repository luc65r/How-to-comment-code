# How to comment code

This is an example of some C code that is perfectly commented and formated.
There is even a Python script to format correctly the C code!


## Example

The perfectly commented and formated C code given as an example is
[here](https://github.com/luc65r/how-to-comment-code/blob/master/perfectly_commented.c).

Have look, you will be amazed how easly understandable a correctly commented
and formated C code is!

You can try to execute the example code by doing `make`, then `./program 100`.
See? The output is as expected!


## Usage of the Python script

`./format.py < some_badly_formated_code.c > perfectly_formated_code.c`
